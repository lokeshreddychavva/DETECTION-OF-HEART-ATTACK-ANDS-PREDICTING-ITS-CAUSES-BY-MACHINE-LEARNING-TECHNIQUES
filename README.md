# MACHINE LEARNING COURSE PROJECT 


This project mainly focusses to design the model for detection of heart diseases and predict the causes for the heart disease.
Heart disease has become primary health problem for most of the population in the world. 
The heart diseases are primarily checked based on ECG and CT scan. These values are also included in dataset as attributes. 
There are many factors which cause heart diseases like lifestyle habits and this project mainly focusses on the primary causes of heart diseases. 
The implementation starts with Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset. On a standard CPU, an accuracy of 81% was achieved.

This project is split into:

1.	Exploratory Data Analysis of dataset containing various attributes related to heart diseases.
2.	Splitting the dataset into train and test data (80% and 20%) and obtaining the target value.
3.	Passing the dataset to the classification models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree and accuracies are obtained by using these techniques.
4.	Accuracy is improved by using boosting technique called Adaboost
